Configure DNS Over HTTPS in Firefox

This worked for me.

First, go to Firefox Options > General > Network Settings and check the box "Enable DNS over HTTPS". This will automatically throw two switches in about:config.

network.trr.mode = 2

network.trr.uri = https://mozilla.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query

Next, in about:config, set network.trr.bootstrapAddress to 1.1.1.1

Finally, set network.security.esni.enabled = true

Check your work by running all four tests at https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/

My laptop passed all four. I had earlier changed the DNS server addresses on Windows 10 to 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1

A DNS leak test now shows an IP address from my VPN and a DNS address from Cloudflare.

If you've been thinking about DNS issues, I hope this helps.

The curl wiki has a nice list of public DoH providers: https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS

And in Nightly at least, under the "Enable DNS over HTTPS" checkbox there's a nice text field for setting a custom network.trr.uri

Why for some users setting network.trr.mode = 2 fails to work? I've set this to 2 and failed to pass the DNSSEC test. It only works for value set to 3 but not sure why.

0: Off by default
1: Firefox will choose based on which is faster
2: TRR preferred, fall back to DNS on failure
3: TRR only, no DNS fallback
5: TRR completely disabled

Perhaps you're talking about the tests failing? Because it seems "3" is the most secure way to go, which is good.

I found this related post:

r/firefox/comments/8b4u9z/with_dns_over_https_enabled_in_nightly_firefox/

And this bug report:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450893

So, it seems currently there's no safe solution.

Tip: It is possible to solve the issue by setting network.trr.mode to 2 instead of 3.
